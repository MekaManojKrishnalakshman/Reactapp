Let's start with an overview of the application flow:

```
[Component] -> [useEffect] -> [dispatch action] -> [API call] -> 
[receive data] -> [dispatch action with data] -> [reducer] -> [update state] -> 
[Component re-renders with new data]
```

Now, let's break this down step by step:

1. State Initialization:



```javascript
const initialState = {
  popular: [],
  action: [],
  adventure: [],
  comedy: [],
  searchResults: [],
};

```

This is the default value of our state when the application starts. All categories are empty arrays.

2. Component Setup:

Let's say we have a component that displays movies of a specific category:



```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { fetchMovies } from '../redux/movieActions';

const MovieCategory = ({ category }) => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const movies = useSelector(state => state.movies[category]);

  useEffect(() => {
    dispatch(fetchMovies(category));
  }, [category, dispatch]);

  return (
    <div>
      {movies.map(movie => (
        <div key={movie.id}>{movie.title}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MovieCategory;

```

3. Hooks and Effect:

- The `useDispatch` hook gives us the `dispatch` function to dispatch actions.
- The `useSelector` hook allows us to select data from the Redux store.
- `useEffect` is used to trigger the data fetching when the component mounts or when the category changes.

4. Dispatching the Action:

When `useEffect` runs, it calls `dispatch(fetchMovies(category))`. This dispatches the `fetchMovies` action creator.

5. Action Creator:



```javascript
export const fetchMovies = (category) => async (dispatch) => {
  try {
    let endpoint;
    switch (category) {
      case "action":
        endpoint = "/discover/movie?with_genres=28";
        break;
      case "adventure":
        endpoint = "/discover/movie?with_genres=12";
        break;
      case "comedy":
        endpoint = "/discover/movie?with_genres=35";
        break;
      case "popular":
      default:
        endpoint = "/movie/popular";
    }

    const response = await axios.get(`${API_BASE_URL}${endpoint}`, {
      params: {
        api_key: API_KEY,
        language: "en-US",
        page: 1,
      },
    });
    dispatch({
      type: "SET_MOVIES",
      payload: { category, movies: response.data.results },
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error fetching ${category} movies:`, error);
  }
};

```

This function:
- Determines the correct API endpoint based on the category
- Makes an API call using axios
- Dispatches a `SET_MOVIES` action with the fetched data

6. API Call and Response:

Let's say we're fetching "action" movies. The API call might return:



```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 101,
      "title": "Die Hard",
      "release_date": "1988-07-15"
    },
    {
      "id": 102,
      "title": "Mad Max: Fury Road",
      "release_date": "2015-05-15"
    }
  ]
}

```

7. Dispatching Action with Data:

After receiving the data, the action creator dispatches:

```javascript
dispatch({
  type: "SET_MOVIES",
  payload: { 
    category: "action", 
    movies: [
      { id: 101, title: "Die Hard", release_date: "1988-07-15" },
      { id: 102, title: "Mad Max: Fury Road", release_date: "2015-05-15" }
    ]
  }
});
```

8. Reducer:

The reducer receives this action and updates the state:



```javascript
const movieReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "SET_MOVIES":
      return {
        ...state,
        [action.payload.category]: action.payload.movies,
      };
    // ... other cases
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

```

9. Spread Operator in Action:

Let's break down how the spread operator works here:

```
Current State:
{
  popular: [],
  action: [],  // This will be updated
  adventure: [],
  comedy: [],
  searchResults: []
}

New State after spread:
{
  ...state,  // This spreads all existing properties
  [action.payload.category]: action.payload.movies  // This adds/updates the 'action' property
}

Result:
{
  popular: [],
  action: [  // This array is replaced with new data
    { id: 101, title: "Die Hard", release_date: "1988-07-15" },
    { id: 102, title: "Mad Max: Fury Road", release_date: "2015-05-15" }
  ],
  adventure: [],
  comedy: [],
  searchResults: []
}
```

The spread operator (`...state`) creates a new object with all properties from the current state. Then, the `[action.payload.category]` syntax dynamically updates the property for the specific category with the new movies array.

10. State Update and Re-render:

After the reducer updates the state, any component that's subscribed to the relevant part of the state (using `useSelector`) will re-render with the new data.

Diagram of the entire process:

```
[MovieCategory Component]
         |
         v
    [useEffect]
         |
         v
[dispatch(fetchMovies("action"))]
         |
         v
 [fetchMovies action creator]
         |
         v
    [API call]
         |
         v
 [Receive API response]
         |
         v
[dispatch({type: "SET_MOVIES", payload: {...}})]
         |
         v
    [movieReducer]
         |
         v
 [New State with updated 'action' movies]
         |
         v
[MovieCategory Component re-renders with new data]
```

This process ensures that:
1. Each category of movies is fetched and stored separately.
2. The state remains organized and easy to manage.
3. Components can easily access the data they need.
4. The UI updates automatically when new data is fetched.

Quiz: What happens if we dispatch a SET_MOVIES action for a category that doesn't exist in the initial state?
a) It will be ignored
b) It will create a new property in the state for that category
c) It will throw an error
d) It will overwrite an existing category

Answer: b) It will create a new property in the state for that category

This is because the spread operator allows us to add new properties to the state object dynamically.
